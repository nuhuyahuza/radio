# Zaa Radio Advertisement Booking System ‚Äî Full Development Prompt

This is a **complete, step-by-step prompt** to guide an AI developer assistant or a human developer team to build the entire Zaa Radio Advertisement Booking System in **PHP/MySQL**, fully Dockerized, with clearly defined **TODOs**, acceptance criteria, and deliverables.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

We are building a **Radio Advertisement Booking System** for **Zaa Radio** (only **one station**). Roles are:

* **Advertisers**: book radio slots via an online calendar.
* **Station Managers**: manage slots and approve/reject bookings. Created only by Admin.
* **Admins**: oversee the system, manage users, and generate reports.

Tech stack: **PHP 7.4, MySQL 5.7+, Apache 2.4, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JS (ES6)**. Containerized with **Docker** and `docker-compose`.

---

## ‚úÖ Execution Rules

1. **Work through TODOs in order** ‚Äî one at a time.
2. **Do not skip ahead.** Only proceed when the current TODO‚Äôs acceptance criteria are satisfied.
3. After each TODO: commit with `todo-<number>: <summary>`.
4. Use Docker for development and production (no local installs).

---

## üìã Dashboard Design (All Roles)

All dashboards (Admin, Station Manager, Advertiser) share a **collapsible sidenav layout**:

* **Top bar**: logo (Zaa Radio), user profile dropdown (settings, logout).
* **Collapsible sidenav** on the left: expandable menu items.
* **Content area** on the right: dynamic page content.

### Admin Dashboard Pages

1. **Overview**: Key stats (bookings, revenue, active advertisers).
2. **Users**: List, create, edit users (only Admin creates station managers).
3. **Slots**: Full slot management (view all slots).
4. **Bookings**: View/manage all bookings.
5. **Reports**: Revenue, bookings, top advertisers, export PDF/Excel.
6. **Audit Logs**: List of system actions.

### Station Manager Dashboard Pages

1. **Overview**: Pending bookings, today‚Äôs schedule.
2. **Slots**: CRUD (create, edit, cancel slots).
3. **Bookings**: Approve/reject advertiser bookings.
4. **Reports**: Station‚Äôs bookings & revenue.

### Advertiser Dashboard Pages

1. **Overview**: Quick booking CTA + current bookings.
2. **My Bookings**: List of past and pending bookings with statuses.
3. **Profile**: Manage name, phone, email, company info.
